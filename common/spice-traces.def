/* This file defines the 'traces' and 'tweaks' for Spice.
   Traces are boolean flags that can be set at runtime and easily tested.
   Tweaks are integer values that can be tweaked for tuning or debug,
   e.g. buffer sizes, bandwidth control parameters, etc.

   This file is designed to be included multiple times and keep definitions
   consistent between the various locations where it's included.
   Before #include'ing it, you should define at least SPICE_TRACE.

   SPICE_TRACE(name, default_value, info): Define a trace (boolean flag)
   SPICE_TWEAK(name, default_value, info): Define a runtime settable value

   SPICE_TWEAK defaults to SPICE_TRACE if not specifically defined.
   You can also specialize SPICE_TWEAK in case the SPICE_TRACE definition
   does not work for this specific use case.
